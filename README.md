# ETIO.ventures Website

## Installation
It's very straightforward to install
```
git clone <repo>
npm install
```

## Running the site
```
npm run start
```
This should open the site at "http://localhost:3000" like any create-react-app

## Terminal.js limitations
Terminal.js is an unfinished feature, but it's fine because I'll be connecting it to a different
backend that requires authentication via metamask wallet eventually. I'll probably fix the issues here and release this
as a library eventually. It is originally based on "react-console-emulator" but I couldn't get their dependencies to work.

## Missing Referenced Components
There are components that aren't currently included. I'll be adding them later, but this is all just done on one branch
for now. I'll be moving these components onto feature branches and creating tickets for implementing them eventually.
